Thank you for using Tag Cloud Generator!
 
 Simply enter the absolute path of the .txt file you'd like to generate, or use the "Browse" button to open the file in the file explorer.

 Then enter the absolute path to the folder in which you'd like to generate the .html file, or use the "Browse" button to open the folder explorer.

 Then you just need to enter the number of words you'd like to generate. The Tag Cloud Generator will generate a tag cloud with that many tags with the highest count, sorted alphabetically.

 If you'd like to include or exclude common words, such as "the" or "and" (among others), then just check the box to indicate your choice.
